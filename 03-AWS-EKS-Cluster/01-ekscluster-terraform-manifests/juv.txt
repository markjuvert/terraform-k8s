Connecting to CLuster ISSUES


1.IF you can't connect to Cluster using the CLI terminal, then run the following command
https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/eks-cluster-connection/

aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name

aws eks --region us-west-2 update-kubeconfig --name My_EKS_Cluster

How do I resolve the "Your current user or role does not have access to Kubernetes objects on this EKS cluster" error in Amazon EKS?
